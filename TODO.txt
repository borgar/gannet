Still to-do:

  write documentation
  comment main files
  add support for textile format
  add support for html format
  
  parse "collections" settings: e.g. DATE_FORMATS

  generate RSS / ATOM feeds for all content groups

  enforce SITE_URL setting (required for feeds)

  support pagination (via generators)

  content groups for all languages (essentially lang based archives)

  preload templates and only render items for existing templates
  only render things that have URLs (aka. allow skipping feeds/cats)

  only render things that have actually changed

  support post drafts :-)

  sitemap.xml
