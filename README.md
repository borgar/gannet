# Gannet 

It's one of those static blog/site generators. Give it some texts and templates and it will build you a website.


## Why on earth would you want this?

You probably wouldn't. I just made it for me.

The story is that I tried to contribute to other similar projects to get the features I needed in, primarily multiple languages, but eventually gave up on the politics and just wrote this. It was quicker and less effort than getting pull requests approved.


## Is there anything special about it?

I don't think there are many groundbreaking ideas to be found here. Some characteristics of the system are:

- It is amazingly fast.
- It handles translations and multiple languages.
- It only renders changed files by examining modification times.
- It prompted me to write [textile-js](https://github.com/borgar/textile-js).
