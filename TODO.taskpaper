Still to-do:
	- Encapsulated things need slugs for urls (or do they?)
	- Switch to a non-homemade arguments parser
	- See if there is an NPM module now to handle the unicode decomposition
	- What happens when two tags serialize to same slug string? -> can filename be org name?
	- Update to a modern version of Swig or some other template system
	- Write some documentation (hah, as if!)
	- Markdown: Marked does not support footnotes syntax (temp hack in place)
	- Generate RSS/ATOM feeds for all content groups
	- Add a setting to control for "absolute" or "relative" url output
	- Support pagination of content groups
	- Content groups for languages (essentially lang based archives)
	- Finish support for categories
	- Finish support for authors (profiles)
	- Only render items that have templates (partially done)
	- Only render things that have URLs (aka. allow skipping feeds/cats)
	- Clean up orphaned files in generated site (if setting)
	- Write a sitemap.xml (partially done)
	- Automatic robots.txt?
	- Only publish things from within past and present (no future dates)
